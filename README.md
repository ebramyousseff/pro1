In this project I made three pages
 The first page: This is the entry page to the project, through which there is a button that when pressed, I can go to 

The second page: This is the page that displays the products in, and each product has a button through which one can go to another page so that I can see the product alone:

I used:Hook
useEffect,useState,useParams,
I also used Router to move well between pages. I hope you like it
